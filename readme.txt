In this project, I have reverse-engineered popular frontend frameworks such as React or Angular by making my own, custom frontend 
framework! Although I have done it in a very crude, oversimplified manner (and haven't even finished it completely), my framework works 
the same way that these modern, component-based frameworks do. I challenged myself to do this to learn more about OOP after becoming
enthralled by OOP theory thanks to one of my favorite professors of all time. This endeavour was much more complicated than I thought it 
would be! However, I am glad that I took on the challenge, fought through the bugs, and learned not only about using APIs but also about
how frontend frameworks actually work. It is strange to consider that there are probably many professionals out there that don't even 
realize how these frameworks work underneath the hood (when I figured it out by myself after a few semester of community college - no 
Googling necessary, believe me or not!). This is why OOP is so heavily taught and endorsed in schools: because it's damn powerful and, 
used properly, works like a charm! 

This project (though unfinished) taught me that OOP is useful in frontend contexts and not just backend contexts. I learned quite a bit 
about the language of JavaScript as well. Finally, I learned that, to truly understand something, one must not rely on abstractions and
rather be very curious about how said abstractions work. I don't mean to throw shade at React and Angular! They are obviously extremely
powerful and convenient (and save you a lot of time), but more developers should be aware of their inner workings.
