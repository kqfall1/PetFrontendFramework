In this project, I have engineered my own, custom frontend framework!  I challenged myself to do this to learn more about OOP after becoming 
enthralled by OOP theory thanks to one of my favorite professors of all time. This was more complicated than I thought it would be! However, I am glad that I took 
on the challenge, fought through the bugs, and learned not only about using APIs but also about how frontend frameworks actually work underneath the hood. I am starting 
to see how powerful OOP really is. This project taught me that OOP is useful in frontend contexts and not just backend contexts.
