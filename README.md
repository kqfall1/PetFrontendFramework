In this project, I have engineered my own, custom frontend framework!  I challenged myself to do this to learn more about OOP after becoming 
enthralled by OOP theory thanks to one of my favorite professors. This more complicated than I thought it would be! However, I am glad that I took 
on the challenge, fought through the bugs, and learned not only about using APIs but also abouthow frontend frameworks actually work. I am starting 
to see how powerful OOP really is. This project (though unfinished) taught me that OOP is useful in frontend contexts and not just backend contexts.
